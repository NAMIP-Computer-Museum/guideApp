## Goal and Scope

The history of calculation, information processig and computation is very rich quickly accelerating over the past century and is driving the industrial revolution and digital transformation of our world. It is marked by many events related to conceptual and technological breakthrough driving by several people and companies. In order to help in the analysis (by researchers) and explanation (to citizens), the NAM-IP Computer Museum developed and released an open source framework based on a the structuration of events in the form of timeline fragments that can be explored using various navigation operation to focus on specific period, aspects (technological, conceptual, cultural, contextual,...) or involved people/organisation.

The current scope is computing heritage and its validation is still on-going in this domain. However the concept could be enlarged any type of historical event and be used by other museum.

## Design ideas / features

The framework is designed in two main component:
* a knowledge base backend to structure all the relevant information, a conceptual model was developed based on different standards (see below) and accessed through queries and/or a specific API to extract

* a navigation frontend
